# Assignment 1: Virtual Machine Setup & Socket Programming

### Due ***Date TBD*** at ***Time TBD***

Welcome to COS 316: Principles of Computer System Design!

Through this and the following  assignments, you will gain hands-on experience with real-world systems and network programming.
You will write a program that allows your computer to communicate with another, be it across the room or across the world.

***TODO: Information about the other assignments of the course, as this becomes available.***
You will program a router to deliver information to the right destination in a network with thousands of nodes.
You will learn how decisions made by protocol designers and network administrators affect Internet performance.  
You will analyze data from Princeton's own network to detect security threats and learn how to prevent them.

The programming assignments are designed to be challenging but manageable in the time allotted.
If you have questions, want to suggest clarifications, or are struggling with any of the assignments this semester, please come to office hours, ask questions on Piazza, or talk to an instructor before or after class.

You are not allowed to copy or look at code from other students. However, you are welcome to discuss the assignments with other students without sharing code.

Let's get started!

## Part A: Set Up Virtual Machine
The first part of this assignment is to set up the virtual machine (VM) you will use for the rest of the course. This will make it easy to install all dependencies for the programming assignments, saving you the tedium of installing individual packages and ensuring your development environment is correct.

### Step 1: Install Vagrant
Vagrant is a tool for automatically configuring a VM using instructions given in a single "Vagrantfile."

**macOS & Windows:**
You need to install Vagrant using the correct download link for your computer here: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html.

**Windows only**:
You will be asked to restart your computer at the end of the installation. Click Yes to do so right away, or restart manually later, but don't forget to do so or Vagrant will not work! You may wish to wait until after you have installed all software (after Step 4), as it is possible several of the programs you'll be installing will require you to restart.

**Linux:**
First, make sure your package installer is up to date by running the command `sudo apt-get update`. To install Vagrant, you must have the "Universe" repository on your computer; run `sudo apt-add-repository universe` to add it. Finally, run `sudo apt-get install vagrant` to install vagrant.

### Step 2: Install VirtualBox
VirtualBox is a VM provider (hypervisor).

**macOS & Windows:**
You need to install VirtualBox using the correct download link for your computer here: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads. The links are under the heading "VirtualBox 6.x.x platform packages."

**macOS only:**
During the installation process you may see one or more messages from the operating system that VirtualBox is requesting access to certain system features. This is normal. The installation may fail the first time around, and prompt you to allow VirtualBox this access via the Security tab of System Preferences. Click the "Allow" button at the bottom of the window, and run the installer again. This time it should finish without issue.

**Windows only:**
Use all the default installation settings, but you can uncheck the "Start Oracle VirtualBox 6.x.x after installation" checkbox.

**Linux:**
Run the command `sudo apt-get install virtualbox`.

**Note:**
This will also install the VirtualBox application on your computer. You should never need to run it, though it is a useful piece of software and it may be helpful (see Step 6).

### Step 3: Install Git (and SSH-capable terminal on Windows)
Git is a distributed version control system. This course does not require any knowledge of Git (all commands you need to know will be provided). However, if you aren't familiar with Git, you should consider learning more. Good version control is an invaluable tool for any software developer, and you will find it extremely useful for future courses (e.g. COS333, COS426).

**macOS & Windows:**
You need to install Git using the correct download link for your computer here: https://git-scm.com/downloads.

**macOS only:**
Once you have opened the .dmg installation file, you will see a Finder window including a `.pkg` file, which is the installer. Opening this normally may give you a prompt saying it can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer. To override this protection, instead right-click on that `.pkg` file and select "Open". This will show a prompt asking you if you are sure you want to open it. Select "Yes". This will take you to the (straightforward) installation.

Depending on your version of macOS, Terminal may also prompt you to install macOS's command-line developer tools from the App Store. We recommend skipping this and installing git directly, so you can be sure the version of git you have installed is as current as possible. That said, we will be using only the most basic functionality of Git in this course, so if you have already installed developer tools, either version should suffice.

**Windows only:**
There are several Git- and SSH-capable terminals available, and which you choose is a matter of personal taste.
The link provided above will download vanilla Git and the MinTTY terminal, which offer the bare bones functionality you need for this course.
My personal recommendation is to use Cmder, a terminal supporting several shells that may make your life as a Windows developer less painful.
Whichever option you choose, *you only need to install Git __once__, using __one__ of the options below.*

*Installing vanilla Git*:
You will be given many options to choose from during the installation; using all the defaults will be sufficient for this course (you can uncheck "View release notes" at the end).
The installation includes an SSH-capable Bash terminal usually located at `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`. You should use this as your terminal in this class, unless you prefer another SSH-capable terminal (the Windows command prompt `cmd.exe` will not work).
Feel free to create a shortcut to it; copying and pasting the executable somewhere else will not work, however. You may also right-click within a directory in Windows Explorer and select "Git Bash here" to open a bash terminal in that directory.

*Installing Git via Cmder:*
Cmder can be downloaded from https://cmder.net/. Be sure to select the *Full installation*, and *not* the Mini installation, which does not include Git. Follow the directions on the site; that is, extract the .zip file to a directory of your choosing. If in doubt, `C:\cmder` will suffice. Feel free to make a shortcut to `cmder.exe` for easier access.
At this point you are done, but if you so desire, you may optionally configure your `PATH` and other environment variables by [following these instructions](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki/Setting-up-Environment-Variables) or add Cmder to your right-click context menu by [following these instructions](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/README.md#context-menu-integration).

*Other options for Windows:*
In recent years Microsoft has taken steps to make Windows more "developer-friendly", including initiatives like [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (WSL), [Windows Terminal 2019](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-windows-terminal/) and a native [Windows OpenSSH-based SSH client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse).
You may use these if you can get them working, but your mileage may vary, and course staff can't guarantee they will work as expected.

**Linux:** `sudo apt-get install git`.

### Step 4: Install X Server
You will need an X Server to input commands to the virtual machine.

**macOS:**
Install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/).
You will need to log out and log back in to complete the installation (as mentioned by the prompt at the end).

**Windows:**
Install [Xming](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/files/Xming/6.9.0.31/Xming-6-9-0-31-setup.exe/download).
Use default options and uncheck "Launch Xming" at the end.

**Linux:** The X server is pre-installed!

### Step 4b: Restart your computer
If you are a Windows user and you have not restarted your computer in a previous step, do so now, or your newly-installed software may not work.

If you are a Mac user and you have not log out and back in the previous step, do so now.

### Step 5: Clone course Git repository
Open your terminal (use the one mentioned in step 3 if using Windows) and `cd` to wherever you want to keep files for this course on your computer.

***TODO: Update repo URL***
Run `git clone https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/COS316-Public`to download the course files from GitHub.

`cd COS316-Public/assignments` to enter the course assignment directory.

### Step 6: Provision virtual machine using Vagrant
From the `assignments` directory you just entered, run the command  `vagrant up` to start the VM and  provision it according to the Vagrantfile. Creating the VM for the first time may take 20 minutes or more, but status messages should be consistently printing to the console. You may see warnings/errors in red, such as "default: stdin: is not a tty", but you shouldn't have worry about them.

**Note 1**: The following commands will allow you to stop the VM at any point (such as when you are done working on an assignment for the day):
* `vagrant suspend` will save the state of the VM and stop it.
* `vagrant halt` will gracefully shutdown the VM operating system and power down the VM.
* `vagrant destroy` will remove all traces of the VM from your system. If you have important files saved on the VM (like your assignment solutions) **DO NOT** use this command.

Additionally, the command `vagrant status` will allow you to check the status of your machine in case you are unsure (e.g. running, powered off, saved...).
You must be in some subdirectory of the directory containing the Vagrantfile to use any of the commands above, otherwise Vagrant will not know which VM you are referring to.

**Note 2**: The VirtualBox application that was installed in Step 2 provides a visual interface as an alternative to these commands, where you can see the status of your VM and power it on/off or save its state. It is not recommended to use it, however, since it is not integrated with Vagrant, and typing commands should be no slower. It is also not an alternative to the initial `vagrant up` since this creates the VM.

### Step 7: Test SSH to VPN

Run `vagrant ssh` from your terminal. This is the command you will use every time you want to access the VM. If it works, your terminal prompt will change to `vagrant@cos316:~$`. All further commands will execute on the VM. You can then run `cd /vagrant` to get to the course directory that's shared between your regular OS and the VM.

Vagrant is especially useful because of this shared directory structure.  You don't need to copy files to and from the VM. Any file or directory in the `assignments` directory where the `Vagrantfile` is located is automatically shared between your computer and the virtual machine. This means you can use your IDE of choice from outside the VM to write your code (but will still have to build and run within the VM).

The command `logout` will stop the SSH connection at any point. You may also press `Ctrl-D` to send an EOF and stop the connection.

### Extra Note for Windows users

Line endings are symbolized differently in DOS (Windows) and Unix (Linux/MacOS). In the former, they are represented by a carriage return and line feed (CRLF, or "\r\n"), and in the latter, just a line feed (LF, or "\n").
Given that you ran `git pull` from Windows, git detects your operating system and adds carriage returns to files when downloading. This can lead to parsing problems within the VM, which runs Ubuntu (Unix).
Fortunately, this only seems to affect the shell scripts (\*.sh files) we wrote for testing. The `Vagrantfile` is set to automatically convert all files back to Unix format, so **you shouldn't have to worry about this**.
**However**, if you want to write/edit shell scripts to help yourself with testing, or if you encounter this problem with some other type of file, use the preinstalled program `dos2unix`. Run `dos2unix [file]` to convert it to Unix format (before editing/running in VM), and run `unix2dos [file]` to convert it to DOS format (before editing on Windows). A good hint that you need to do this when running from the VM is some error message involving `^M` (carriage return). A good hint you need to do this when editing on Windows is the lack of new lines. Remember, doing this should only be necessary if you want to edit shell scripts. You can also configure many modern editors (Atom, VSCode, Sublime) to use the correct line endings.

### Step 8: Go take a break. You've earned it!

## Part B: Socket Programming

**Part B is individual.**

As discussed in lecture, socket programming is the standard way to write programs that communicate over a network. While originally developed for Unix computers programmed in C, the socket abstraction is general and not tied to any specific operating system or programming language. This allows programmers to use the socket mental model to write correct network programs in many contexts.

This part of the assignment will give you experience with basic socket programming. You will write two programs for transmitting text messages over the Internet: a client for sending and a server for receiving. Both the client and server must be written in Go.

The client and server programs should meet the following specifications. Be sure to read these meticulously before and after programming to make sure your implementation fulfills them:

### Server specification
* The server program should listen on a socket, wait for a client to connect, receive a message from the client, print the message to stdout, and then wait for the next client indefinitely.
* The server should take one command-line argument: the port number to listen on for client connections.
* The server should accept and process client communications in an infinite loop, allowing multiple clients to send messages to the same server. The server should only exit in response to an external signal (e.g. SIGINT from pressing `ctrl-c`).
* The server should maintain a short (5-10) client queue and handle multiple client connection attempts sequentially. In real applications, a TCP server would fork a new process to handle each client connection concurrently, but that is **not necessary** for this assignment.
* The server should gracefully handle error values potentially returned by socket programming library functions (see specifics below). Errors related to handling client connections should not cause the server to exit after handling the error; all others should.

### Client specification
* The client program should contact a server, read a message from stdin, send the message, and exit.
* The client should read and send the message *exactly* as it appears in stdin until reaching an EOF (end-of-file).
* The client should take two command-line arguments: the IP address of the server and the port number of the server.
* The client must be able to handle arbitrarily large messages by iteratively reading and sending chunks of the message, rather than reading the whole message into memory first.
* The client should handle partial sends (when a socket only transmits part of the data given in the last send operation) by attempting to re-send the rest of the data until it has all been sent.
* The client should gracefully handle error values potentially returned by socket programming library functions.

### Error Handling
Generally speaking, there are several reasonable actions that a program might take upon realizing that it has encountered an error, and you may (or may not) sometimes need to take one or more of these actions.
* **Attempt to recover:**
    Some errors may arise due to chance events like a busy or noisy network, and in these cases it is possible (and desirable) to try to recover gracefully, perhaps by trying the exact same operation again, or by tweaking some values
    first and then retrying.
* **Crash:**
    On the other hand, some errors cannot be recovered from at runtime. If the user requests access to some resource that is already being used by another process, there is no straightforward way to recover, and crashing (with an informative message) would be an acceptable response.
* **Print error message:**
    Especially for fatal errors that cause your program to crash, it is good style to print out a message indicating what has gone wrong. For non-fatal errors, you may find it useful to print messages for debugging purposes. For your final submit, you should make an effort to minimize output by commenting out any debugging statements.
* **Do nothing:**
    It is generally poor style to leave potential errors unhandled, as your program might continue executing, believing everything to be OK, only to crash later on in a way that will be much harder to debug. Your program should make an effort to handle all reasonable errors that may arise.

#### Error Handling in Go
Go has several error handling functions that may be of use to you:
* `log.Fatal(message string)`<sup>[(docs)](http://golang.org/pkg/log/#Fatal)</sup>: Print message to `os.Stderr` and terminate the program with a return code of 1.
* `log.Print(message string)`<sup>[(docs)](https://golang.org/pkg/log/#Print)</sup>: Prints message to stderr.
* `log.Panic(message string)`<sup>[(docs)](https://golang.org/pkg/log/#Panic)</sup>:Prints the error message, and then calls `panic()`, which propagates the error, and prints a stack trace if unhandled. `panic()` is similar to Java's `throw`. It differs from `log.Fatal()` in that deferred functions are executed before the program exits (perhaps freeing resources or flushing buffers). An interesting note is that callers can recover from a panic using `recover()` (analagous to `catch` in Java), but you will *not* need to make use of this functionality for this assignment. See [this blog post](https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover) for more on `defer()`, `panic()`, and `recover()`.

### Getting started

Do all building and testing on the Vagrant VM. You may either write your code on the Vagrant VM (both Emacs and Vim text editors are pre-installed) or directly on your OS (allowing you to use any editor you have installed). After running `vagrant ssh` from your terminal, run `cd /vagrant` to get to the course directory.

We have provided scaffolding code in the `assignment1/client_server/` directory. *You should read and understand this code before starting to program.*

You should program only in the locations of the provided files marked with `TODO` comments. There is one `TODO` section for the client and one for the server.

You can add functions if you wish, but do not change file names, as they will be used for automated testing.

The following section provides details for implementing the client and server programs in Go.

### Go
The documentation for Go socket programming is located here: https://golang.org/pkg/net/.  
The overview at the top and the section on the [Conn type](https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Conn) will be most relevant. You may also find the buffered [Reader](https://golang.org/pkg/bufio/#Reader) and [Writer](https://golang.org/pkg/bufio/#Writer) types to be useful, but you are not required to use them, and you can construct a working solution without them.

The Go language (Golang) documentation can be cryptic, so be sure to familiarize yourself with the language a bit first, especially if you are new to Go. You may find the [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/list) documentation useful if you have never used Go before.

The files `client.go` and `server.go` contain the scaffolding code. You will need to add socket programming code in the locations marked `TODO`. The reference solutions have roughly 40  (well commented and spaced) lines of code in the `TODO` sections of each file. Your implementations may be shorter or longer.

The Go `Listen` function maintains a queue of connecting clients by default.
No additional programming is required.

You should build your solution by running `make` in the `assignment1/client_server` directory. Your code *must* build using the provided Makefile.
The server should be run as `./server [port] > [output file]`.
The client should be run as `./client [server IP] [server port] < [message file]`.
See "Testing" for more details.

### Testing

You should test your implementation by attempting to send messages from your client to your server. The server can be run in the background (append a `&` to the command) or in a separate SSH window. You should use `127.0.0.1` (i.e. the "localhost", or "loopback", address) as the server IP and a high server port number between 10000 and 60000.

You can kill a background server with the command `fg` to bring it to the foreground then `ctrl-c`. Conversely, you can send a foreground process to the background by hitting `ctrl-z` to suspend the process, and typing the command `bg` to resume the process in the background.

The Bash script `test_client_server.sh` will test your implementation by attempting to send several different messages between your client and server.
The messages are the following:

0. The short message "Go Tigers!\n"
0. A long, randomly generated alphanumeric message
0. A long, randomly generated binary message
0. Several short messages sent sequentially from separate clients to one server
0. Several long, random alphaumeric messages sent concurrently from separate clients to one server

Run the script as

`./test_client_server.sh [server port]`

If you get a permissions error, run `chmod 744 test_client_server.sh` to give the script execute privileges.

The test script will print "SUCCESS" if the message is sent and received correctly. Otherwise it will print a diff of the sent and received message if the diff output is human-readable, i.e., just for tests 1 and 4.

### Debugging hints
Here are some debugging tips. If you are still having trouble, ask a question on Piazza or see an instructor during office hours.

* There are defined buffer size constants in the scaffolding code. Use them. If you are not using one of them, either you have hard-coded a value, which is bad style, or you are very likely doing something wrong.
* There are multiple ways to read and write from stdin/stdout in Go. Any method is acceptable as long as it does not read an unbounded amount into memory at once and does not modify the message.
* If you are using buffered I/O to write to stdout, make sure to call `flush` or the end of a long message may not write.
* Remember to close the socket at the end of the client program.
* When testing, make sure you are using `127.0.0.1` as the server IP argument to the client and the same server port for both client and server programs.
* If you get "address already in use" errors, make sure you don't already have a server running. Otherwise, restart your ssh session with the command `logout` followed by `vagrant ssh`.
* If you are getting other connection errors, try a different port between 10000 and 60000.

### Q&A
* **I'm getting an error when I run the command `vagrant up`. What do I do?**
Many errors/warnings are not a problem and do not need to be addressed, such a `==> default: stdin: is not a tty`. Usually, errors starting with `==> default` should not be worried about, but others should, in particular if they cause the process to be aborted. Use `vagrant status` to see if the VM is running after `vagrant up`; if it is not, then there is a real problem. Here are some known errors and how to fix them:
    * **"A Vagrant environment or target machine is required to run this command..."**:
      you must run `vagrant up` from a subdirectory of the directory containing the Vagrantfile (in the case, `assignments`).
    * **"Vagrant cannot forward the specified ports on this VM, since they would collide with some other application that is already listening on these ports..."**:
      perhaps you cloned the repository twice and the VM is already running on one of them. Since they both use the same port, they cannot run at the same time. You may also have some other application using port 8888. To help find what is using it, follow
      [these](http://osxdaily.com/2014/05/20/port-scanner-mac-network-utility/) instructions for macOS,
      [these](https://techtalk.gfi.com/scan-open-ports-in-windows-a-quick-guide/) for Windows and
      [these](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Nmap#Port_scan) for Linux (you may have to install `nmap`).
      Use 127.0.0.1 as the IP and 8888-8888 as the port range in your port scan.
    * **"VBoxManage.exe: error: Details: code E_FAIL (0x80004005), component MachineWrap, interface IMachine"**:
      Try rebooting your host machine (i.e. your laptop). If this fails to fix the issue, you may have other virtualization software installed that conflicts with Vagrant or VirtualBox, which you will need to disable.
    * **"Windows detected. Remember to set DISPLAY"**:
      This relates to the X11 server you installed in a previous step. We are not using the X11 server for this assignment, so you can ignore this message for now.

  If this did not help you fix the problem, please ask on Piazza or at office hours.
* **I'm using Cmder on Windows, and the terminal window is flickering rapidly when I'm connected to the virtual machine**
  This is a [known issue](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1625) that happens especially when trying to use a terminal application like Emacs or vim. The root cause is an incompatibility between the Windows OpenSSH implementation (which is likely preinstalled on your machine) and the ConEmu software underlying Cmder. You will have to uninstall Windows' version of OpenSSH by following the directions [here](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1625#issuecomment-413459750). This is no great loss, as you've already installed a more reliable SSH client as part of the VM setup steps above.

* **Do I need to handle signals such as SIGINT to clean up the server process when the user presses `ctrl-c`?**
  No, it is not necessary in this assignment. The default response to signals is good enough.
  Keep in mind it would be good practice to do so in general, however.
* **Should I use stream (TCP) or datagram (UDP) sockets?**
  Please use stream (TCP) sockets, to ensure that the exact message is delivered.
  Streams ensure reliable, in-order packet transmission, whereas datagram packets are not guaranteed to be delivered.
* **Should the client wait to receive a reply from the server?**
  No, in this assignment it should exit immediately after sending all the data.
* **Should the server handle client connections concurrently (in separate processes)?**
  No, as stated in the client specification, this is not required in this assignment.
  So no need to use `syscall.ForkExec()` or any other system-level `fork()`!



### Submission and grading
***TODO: Update link***
Submit the assignment by uploading your modified client and server files to TigerFile here:
[Assignment 1 - Socket Programming](https://dropbox.cs.princeton.edu/COS461_S2019/Assignment-1-Socket-Programming).

We will grade your assignments by running the `test_client_server.sh` script and additional tests with large messages, multiple simultaneous clients, etc. Double check the specifications above and perform your own tests before submitting.

Code that does not compile is graded harshly; if you want partial credit on code that doesn't compile, comment it out and make sure your file compiles!

Remember that you should submit two files: a server file and a client file, both written in Go!
